Action space definitions and validity masks.

Phase 1 action space (20 discrete actions):
  0  WAIT          – pass one tick
  1  MOVE_UP       – x - 1
  2  MOVE_DOWN     – x + 1
  3  MOVE_LEFT     – y - 1
  4  MOVE_RIGHT    – y + 1
  5  BUY           – buy the best affordable product at the adjacent market
  6  SELL_0        – sell all eligible carried product-0 (semiconductor) at adjacent market
  7  SELL_1        – sell all eligible carried product-1 (medicine)
  8  SELL_2        – sell all eligible carried product-2 (small_goods)
  9  SELL_3        – sell all eligible carried product-3 (clothing)
 10 SELL_4        – sell all eligible carried product-4 (food)
  11 HARVEST       – harvest raw materials from nearby resource point
  12 DEPOSIT       – deposit unit's raw_inv into factory (must be at factory)
  13 PRODUCE_0     – queue product-0 for production (at factory, costs raw_stock)
  14 PRODUCE_1     – queue product-1
  15 PRODUCE_2     – queue product-2
  16 PRODUCE_3     – queue product-3
  17 PRODUCE_4     – queue product-4
  18 LOAD          – load produced goods from factory into unit inventory
  19 OCCUPY        – progress occupation of adjacent compute center

Phase 2 action space (8 tech upgrades, cost compute pts, must be at factory):
  20 TECH_0        – cost_reduction    (50 pts): product buy cost -2
  21 TECH_1        – efficiency        (40 pts): production time ×0.5
  22 TECH_2        – marketing         (80 pts): sell price ×1.1
  23 TECH_3        – durability        (30 pts): unit max HP +50%
  24 TECH_4        – multi_line        (60 pts): +1 production line
  25 TECH_5        – path_optimization (50 pts, needs TECH_1): move costs -1 busy tick
  26 TECH_6        – market_analysis   (40 pts, non-persistent): reveal best price in obs
  27 TECH_7        – compute_expansion (70 pts): compute accrual rate +30%
